# About 📝
During my childhood, I attended music therapy sessions, where I spent hours singing fun songs and experimenting with unique instruments. However, in high school, I learned that many children with the Autism Spectrum Disorder do not have access to these types of services. This motivated me to develop PocketStory, an app featuring educational games designed to help autistic children learn the skills taught in music therapy!

# The process 💬

Being unfamiliar with app development at the time, I took an online course to teach myself Swift and iOS development. Meanwhile, I got in contact and established partnerships with two community organizations, CHIM Studio in the Bay Area and PCDA in LA. Throughout the process of developing the app, I also collaborated with two friends in designing the illustrations and producing the background music.

# Features 🧩
* New Story: users can create their own story featuring these scenes:
  - Amusement Park
    -  The user can choose from one of these characters: dog, cat, cow
    -  The user goes to a snack shop and chooses one of the following:
        -  Pizza: a game that tests your knowledge of identifying numbers
        -  Hotdog: a game that tests your knowledge of identifying colors
        -  Popcorn: a game where you catch falling popcorn into a bucket
    -  After that, they'll be taken to a photobooth to take a picture at one of the following places: a river, campfire, or beach
        -  The user can then move their character wherever they want, and pressing the camera button will take a screenshot and save it to the user's camera roll
  - School (coming soon)
  - Farm (coming soon)
* Minigames
  - An interactive keyboard where the user can play their favorite tunes on the piano!
  - Counting pizzas, hotdog colors, and popcorn catch games so that they can play them without having to start a new story at the amusement park
* Playlist
  - The user can listen any of the background OSTs, and pause and resume as needed.

# Results 🏆
This project led me to earn the Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award a Girl Scout can earn with only about 5.4% of those eligible earning it. When the app was finished, I published it to the App Store and showcased the game to a child development center. Watching the children’s faces light up as they played further emphasized how impactful resources like these can have.

# What's next🔭

Although I could only afford one year of the Apple Developer membership, I hope to add more improvements and bug fixes and get it back on the App Store in the near future. I also hope to add more accessible features, such as verbal instructions or music/sound effect volume control, and include even more options for customization. 

Having no web development experience at the time, I created a landing page website on Wix: https://bit.ly/PocketStory. Now that I do, I hope to make some small improvements and update that as well.
