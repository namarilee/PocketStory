# About 📝
During my childhood, I attended music therapy sessions, where I spent hours singing fun songs and experimenting with unique instruments. However, in high school, I learned that many children with the Autism Spectrum Disorder do not have access to these types of services. This motivated me to develop PocketStory, an app featuring educational games designed to help autistic children learn the skills taught in music therapy!
