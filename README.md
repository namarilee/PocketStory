# About 📝
During my childhood, I attended music therapy sessions, where I spent hours singing fun songs and experimenting with unique instruments. However, in high school, I learned that many children with the Autism Spectrum Disorder do not have access to these types of services. This motivated me to develop PocketStory, an app featuring educational games designed to help autistic children learn the skills taught in music therapy!

# Tools used 🛠
* Swift
* Xcode IDE
* Git/Github
* Canva Pro
* Figma
* Logic Pro X


# The process 💬
Being unfamiliar with app development at the time, I took an online course to teach myself Swift and iOS development. Meanwhile, I got in contact and established partnerships with two community organizations, CHIM Studio in the Bay Area and PCDA in LA. Throughout the process of developing the app, I also collaborated with two friends in designing the illustrations and producing the background music.

# Features 🧩
* New Story: users can create their own story featuring these scenes:
